The input files are lab2_3mons.out and lab2_4mons.out.

The output files are all of the files that start with the root
of the input file but end with '.<thread-name>.txt'.

The output files prove that the script works as intended as you
can see all of the output in the two input files are each individually 
split into their respective output files which are correctly named,
follow the same format as the original output file, and have the time
span appended to the bottom of the output which satisfies all of the 
conditions of the program.
