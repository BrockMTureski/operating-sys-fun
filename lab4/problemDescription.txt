The bash script begins by ensuriung that the number of arguments passed
is 1 and the file passed as the argument exists. The script exits if either
check fails. The script then goes and grabs the reader thread output 
messages by filtering for the thread logs that contain R and prints them
to to a seperate file using grep. The script then subtracts the time taken
between the first log and the last and adds the thread duration to the end
of the file. The script continues on to do the exact same thing as with
the reader thread but this time collects printer thread outputs by filtering
for P thread using grep. Finally the script then does the same thing for each
of the machines by going through and storing all of the different machine numbers
found in the thread logs and then using a for loop and filtering the individual
machines logs into their own file.
