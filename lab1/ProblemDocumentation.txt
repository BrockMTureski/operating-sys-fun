The purpose of this lab was to build a loadable kernel module that returns information about the
 running processâ€™s process identification number (PID) and its parent (PPID), user identifiers (UID), 
and group identifiers (GID).  

The program chain starts with module_init whose parameter calls the function lab1_init. Lab1_init 
contains proc_create whose last parameter is a pointer to the structure whose functions will generate 
the contents of the file which is lab1_fops. After lab1_fops, lab1_open uses single_open to produce 
the proc output from the function lab1_show. 

The contents of the lab1_show function starts by initializing the PID and PPID variables. The current pointer
points to the PID value while the task_ppid_nr fuction takes the current pointer as a parameter to access the 
PPID value. The STATE variable is initialized by the current pointer accessing the state value. All of the UID 
and GID values are initialized and assigned to the value accessed by the current pointer pointing to the cred 
struct, whose pointer points to the individual values. Each of the values are added to the file using the 
seq_printf() function.
